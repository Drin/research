### About Me

I am currently a 3rd year PhD student in computer science ([CMPS][web-phdreqs]) at UC Santa Cruz,
advised by [Peter Alvaro][person-palvaro]. My research interest is in the intersection of data
management systems, storage systems, programming languages, and bioinformatics. I primarily work
with Peter Alvaro, Carlos Maltzahn, and Jeff LeFevre; but, I also work with Josh Stuart and Philip
Kufeldt (Seagate). Additionally, I am trying to contribute to the [Apache Arrow][community-arrow]
and [Human Cell Atlas][community-hca] communities.


### [Research](research/README.md)

This website will include research-related content in the form of blog posts. I am hoping to
include paper reviews, paper presentation materials, and any strong opinions that I think have
general value.

The table below lists my most recent blog posts. I will try to regularly add posts, but I have
historically been very bad at this.

| Topic    | Date     | Title                                                                     |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| personal | 21-03-22 | [Spring Break 2021](research/personal/quarter-end-2021-03.md)             |



#### &middot; [Reading Queue](readings/reading-queue.md)
I think it would be nice to keep a public reading queue. I welcome recommendations, and hope that
this serves at least two purposes: what papers are important to a particular field and a marker of
particularly interesting papers.
