# Spring Break 2021 [DRAFT]

This is the first post of my content refresh. I have now finished the first quarter of my 3rd year,
and I feel like I have so much more work to do. This is the start of my spring break (3/22 - 3/26)
and... oh wow, I just realized I actually finished my second quarter.

...

So, the whole of 2020 that was affected by the pandemic was quite a blur. Some things I did felt
very real and relatively normal, such as my summer internship at Seagate. Many things were
forgotten and only occasionally are remembered, such as the first quarter of my 3rd year. For
better and for worse, I have been relatively productive so far in 2021. The upside being that I've
been productive, the downside being that I was un-productive before and that the pandemic is still
going strong.
